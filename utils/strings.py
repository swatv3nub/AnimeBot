The links provided are in multiple qualities to download just open links in chrome and download starts automatically
                
**(HDP-mp4)** links can be direclty opened in VLC or MX player to stream episodes without downloading

**MixdropSV** links usually have lowest size for 720p
                
I suggest open the links in **1DM** app on playstore instead of chrome for easy downloading
